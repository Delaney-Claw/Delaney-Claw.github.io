Syringe pumps can be key pieces of equipment to deliver medication or nutrients to patients in the hospital. However, these devices are hundreds of dollars each. My team designed a low-cost syringe pump using a combination of 3D printed and off-the-shelf parts that can deliver fluids at a given flow rate.   

Operation: The desired flow rate is entered in the computer and the code is synced to the device. It begins pumping the liquid and will stop when the syringe is empty. The LCD screen displays the flow rate and the light indicates when the liquid is pumping.
