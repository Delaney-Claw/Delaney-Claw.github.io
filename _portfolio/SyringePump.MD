Syringe pumps can be key pieces of equipment to deliver medication or nutrients to patients in the hospital. However, these devices are hundreds of dollars each. My team designed a low-cost syringe pump using a combination of 3D printed and off-the-shelf parts that can deliver fluids at a given flow rate.
