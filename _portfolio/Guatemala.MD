I travelled to Guatemala City and Antigua to repair medical equipment at four hospitals during spring break of 2023. We collaborated with Universidad del Valle de Guatemala engineering students. We worked together switching between Spanish and English. The trip taught me about low-resource design, how to evaluate equipment, and isolate the source of a problem.
