I participated the Tikkun Olam Makers Makeathon for three years. Each year I had a unique project that we custom-built for a disabled person in the Nashville community, who we call our "need-knower."

{% include gallery caption="This is a sample gallery with images of my group working throughout the 2023 Makeathon to build a wheelchair ramp." %}

2023: Michelle, a graduate student at Vanderbilt, needed a wheelchair ramp to help get her new power wheelchair into the trunk of her Toyota Corolla. The design folded small enough so the wheelchair and ramp could both fit with room to spare in the trunk. Michelle struggles with lifting heavy weight so we designed a crank system to pull the wheelchair up the ramp for her. 

2022: The planned project fell through, so my group chose an improvised project in only half the time. We worked with a group member's younger sister to design a bra that could be put on with the use of one hand. This design utilized a set of laces to pull the sides together and velcro instead of small, finicky clasps. It is easily replicable across multiple articles of clothing and removable to avoid laces staying under the shirt all day. 

2021: Our need knower was a six-year-old girl who uses a reverse walker. This meant she couldn't carry an item with her, such as a book or doll, because both hands needed to be on the handlebars. We created a basket that rotated from the side to the front so it would be both out of the way while walking and in front where she could reach in. It included many pockets and, of course, was trimmed with pink lace and butterfly patches!
